2. [**Mean, Median, Mode.**](03_mean.html) Write your own functions for calculating the median and mean.
3. [**Spread of the Data**](04_variance.html). Write your own functions for calculating the variance and the standard deviation.
4. [**Covariance and Correlation**](05_correlation.html) Write your own function to quantify the strength of the relationship between two variables.
5. [**Standard Error, Introduction to Inference**](06_standardError.html)
